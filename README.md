Overview
This project explores timestamped production data from a paper mill to monitor performance, identify trends, detect anomalies, and support real-time operational decisions. It introduces time series analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib, with applications in industrial process monitoring.

🎯 Objectives
Clean and prepare time series production data

Resample and aggregate data by:

Hour

Day

Week

Visualize trends, seasonality, and shifts

Detect anomalies or unexpected drops in production

Lay the foundation for a real-time production monitoring system

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python 3.x

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

📂 Dataset
production_data.csv

Contains production logs over several months with at least:

Timestamp (datetime)

Machine_ID

Production_Amount

🔧 Setup Instructions
Install required Python packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Place your production_data.csv file in the project folder.

Open the Jupyter notebook and run through the cells.

⚙️ Features
Datetime Parsing & Indexing
Convert timestamps to datetime objects and set as index.

Time-Based Aggregation
Use resample() to compute hourly, daily, and weekly summaries.

Trend & Seasonality Analysis
Line plots and moving averages to reveal patterns.

Rolling Statistics
Apply window functions to calculate rolling mean, std, etc.

Anomaly Detection (Basic)
Flag sudden dips/spikes in production.

📊 Sample Code
python
Copy
Edit
# Parse datetime and set index
df['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Timestamp'])
df.set_index('Timestamp', inplace=True)

# Resample production to daily
daily_production = df['Production_Amount'].resample('D').sum()

# Plot
daily_production.plot(figsize=(12, 5), title='Daily Production Output')
📈 Expected Output
Cleaned and time-indexed dataset

Resampled summaries (hourly, daily, weekly)

Visual plots of trends, seasonality, and production anomalies

Insight into machine and shift-level performance

Prototype for real-time monitoring tools
